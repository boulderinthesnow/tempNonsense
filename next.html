	<li class="heading">What do you what to do when you grow up?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My career goals are fairly nebulous - but for the moment the next step is to work in a way-cool company doing far-out things. Preferably somewhere with food. Web dev stuff sounds a lot more interesting than hand optimizing some load process somewhere, so my focus is more on the front end.</p>
	<ul>
	<li class="heading">If gSchool could give you one thing...</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My gGschool goal is to get my programming in working order to the point where someone would pay me real money to do full stack development. My other goal is to avoid coding in C as much/long as possible.</p> 
	<ul>
	<li class="heading">The Big Ask</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My Big Dream is to build another company - but that might be after I pay off my crippling student loan debt. </p>
